I'm currently working at [Osones](http://osones.com): a French Tech company. We're mostly doing public Cloud integration on AWS and Cloud building on OpenStack. We're also pushing DevOps concepts to customers, from cloud native app development to production.

I usually write in French for [Osones' blog](http://blog.osones.com) (soon in English too) and here in English.

Feel free to [contact us](mailto:contact@osones.com).
